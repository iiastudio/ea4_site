The first stage involves designing the self-residence of Wang Da-hong as an initial exercise. In the second stage, I selected the Vault House as my case study, analyzing the variations in spatial openings and the connections between spaces. From this analysis, I derived the concept of continuously evolving space for the third stage, where I integrate the design into the site.\n\nDue to the need for a certain length to express spatial continuity, I initially connected the spaces with bends. However, excessive turns disrupted the continuity, so I started connecting the spaces with small angles. The site’s size did not allow for these bends on a horizontal plane, so I transitioned to vertical curves, creating a circular form. Utilizing circular space necessitated solving vertical circulation issues. I initially considered a zigzag ascent within the circular tube, but this weakened spatial integrity. Consequently, I designed the staircase to follow the curve of the circle.\n\nWhen the stair depth reached 28 centimeters, I fixed the slope and extended the space outward, forming a passage that maintained spatial integrity. Considering the existing ventilation towers on the site, I left a passage at the bottom of the circular space to allow airflow within the tube without protruding additional ventilation ducts, thereby preserving the central hole of the circle.\n\nFinally, to enhance the overall circulation, I created small openings that evoke a sacred atmosphere. The vertical circulation at the back was designed to resemble medieval European spiral staircases, encouraging the occupants to leave behind external distractions and achieve a contemplative state, thus creating a space that tends towards \"melancholy.\"",
